      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Diverse origins<br />I was born in Makati but left the Philippines with my family when I was ten years old in search of a better life in the U.S. And, it’s been a very good life for us. We immigrated to Los Angeles, which was and continues to be a very ethnically diverse community. For that reason, I didn’t feel like an outsider or foreigner. My brothers and I made friends with other Filipinos, as well as children of many other nationalities. I remember now how diverse my close circle of friends was: they included Hector from Mexico, John who was Black, Robert who was Armenian, and many other nationalities as well as religious backgrounds. Thinking back to my childhood, it strikes me how fortunate I was that no one was “othered” in that community. None of our families questioned each other or even pointed out our different races, backgrounds, or faiths. I attended Passover Seder celebrations, Cinco de Mayo and Lunar New Year parties, along with the run-of- the-mill Easter egg hunts and watching fireworks on the 4th of July. Those early days and experiences influenced my beliefs that we all belong, that we are all equal and entitled to everything the U.S. has to offer.</p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Inclusive work culture<br />I began my journey with Visa over 30 years ago and have had the opportunity to work on many aspects of Visa’s technology. Today, I am the senior vice president of the Digital and Developer Platform group, an engineering organization behind Visa’s most future-oriented digital payment technologies.Visa’s mission is to enable individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. I’ve seen again and again how powerful a tool inclusion is in motivating teams to drive superior results – to themselves thrive as the products they produce enable financial inclusion and uplift others around the world. I stay at Visa because this mission matches my own aspirations and, as a father, the aspirations I have for my daughters: a world that sees them as women who have a right to all the same measures of fairness, justice, and equality without fear of violent attacks or discrimination.</p>]]></Value>
